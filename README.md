Created Dashboard (Visualization) of Chocolate shipment data using Power BI 


This dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of the E-commerce business performance, focusing on sales, profit, orders, and customer behavior.

Here's an analysis of the dashboard components:

1. Overall Performance Summary (KPIs at the Top)
Total Sales: 20.35M (Million) - This indicates the total revenue generated by the e-commerce business. It's a substantial figure, showing a large sales volume.
Total Profit: 2.15M (Million) - This represents the net earnings after deducting costs.
Total Orders: 51.29K (Thousand) - This is the total count of individual transactions or orders placed.
Total Quantity: 177.3K (Thousand) - This shows the total number of individual items sold across all orders.
Initial Insight: With 20.35M in sales and 2.15M in profit, the profit margin is approximately 10.57% (2.15/20.35 * 100), which is a healthy margin for many e-commerce businesses. The high number of orders (51K+) and quantity sold (177K+) suggest a busy operation.

2. Sales & Profit Trends Over Time (Total Sales & Profit by Order Date - Line Chart)
Observation: The line chart shows the performance of sales and profit over time. There appears to be fluctuations, with some periods showing higher sales and profit than others.
Analysis: This chart is crucial for identifying trends, seasonality, and the impact of promotions or external events. Without a specific date range visible (e.g., month names on the x-axis are truncated), it's hard to pinpoint exact seasonal peaks, but overall, it appears the business maintains a relatively consistent, albeit fluctuating, level of sales and profit. The profit line generally follows the sales line, indicating that higher sales often translate to higher profits.
3. Sales Distribution by Key Dimensions
Sales by Product Category (Bar Chart):

Observation: 'Electronics' is by far the highest-performing product category in terms of sales. Other categories like 'Home & Furniture' and 'Books' also contribute significantly, but less than electronics.
Analysis: 'Electronics' is the star performer and likely a key driver of revenue. The business might consider focusing marketing efforts on this category or cross-selling related items. Categories with lower sales might need strategies for improvement or diversification.
Sales by Device Type (Pie Chart):

Observation: 'Mobile' and 'Web' are the dominant device types for sales, with 'Mobile' appearing to have a slight edge or similar share to 'Web'. 'Desktop' accounts for a much smaller portion.
Analysis: This highlights the importance of optimizing the mobile shopping experience. A significant portion of sales comes from mobile devices, reinforcing the mobile-first approach for design and marketing.
Sales by Gender (Bar Chart):

Observation: Sales are almost equally split between 'Male' and 'Female' customers, with a slightly higher sales contribution from 'Female'.
Analysis: This indicates a balanced customer base in terms of gender, meaning marketing strategies might need to appeal to both genders equally, or slight adjustments can be made to target the slightly higher-contributing segment.
4. Profitability Insights
Profit by Payment Method (Bar Chart):
Observation: 'Credit Card' is the most profitable payment method by a significant margin. 'Cash on Delivery' also contributes, but less than credit cards. 'Debit Card' is a notable contributor.
Analysis: This suggests that transactions via credit card are either higher in value, involve higher-margin products, or incur lower processing costs. Encouraging credit card usage could potentially boost overall profitability.
5. Operational Insights
Aging Orders by Order Priority (Stacked Bar Chart):
Observation: This chart shows the distribution of order "aging" (presumably how many days an order has been open or pending) across different priorities (e.g., 'High', 'Medium', 'Critical'). For instance, 'Critical' priority orders seem to have a relatively low aging value, while 'Medium' might have a wider spread.
Analysis: This is crucial for logistics and customer satisfaction. It helps identify if high-priority orders are being processed quickly and if there are any bottlenecks for lower-priority orders. If 'Critical' orders have low aging, it implies effective prioritization. If 'High' or 'Medium' orders show significant aging, it could indicate delays in fulfillment that need to be addressed.
6. Dashboard Filters
Filters for Year, Quarter, Month, and Order Priority: These filters (though not actively applied in the screenshot) are very powerful.
Analysis: They allow users to drill down into specific periods or types of orders. For example, one could analyze sales trends for 'Electronics' in 'Q4 2019' to understand seasonal spikes or drops, or examine aging orders only for 'High' priority to focus on critical operational aspects.
Overall Conclusion:
The E-commerce dashboard provides a good snapshot of the business's health. It highlights the dominance of 'Electronics' and mobile/web channels in sales, a balanced gender contribution, and the profitability of credit card payments. The operational chart on aging orders is key for identifying and managing fulfillment efficiency. The filters enable granular analysis, making this a versatile tool for business decision-making.
